                                    <p align="justify"><strong>Dear Ok Lifecare Family Members, I hope you are well.</strong></p>
									<p align="justify">The wave of Ok Lifecare’ business expansion, is self-innovation and self-enhancement, encouraging us to continue to explore and create the world around us. This task is arduous and cumbersome but as I have said on many occasions, “our struggles will not cease so long as we are alive”. This is an inherent determination of our Ok Lifecare people, a spirit, an attitude, an important component of Ok Lifecare culture. 03 years of practice proves that our quick development, outstanding business performance, achievement of so many goals are all a result of superior teamwork, tremendous hard work and continuous learning and innovation.</p> 
									
									<p align="justify">At this moment, as the CEO, I would like to share with you the following words: Learning, Innovation, Collaboration, Diligence, Striving and Happiness.</p>
									
									<p align="justify"><strong>Learning</strong></p>
									
									<p align="justify">Learning should never stop. It is the foundation and essence of self-enhancement and enterprise development. We are now living in a time when society, knowledge and technology are changing and developing at a rapid pace. Big Data, Cloud Computing, Information overload, Digitalization, Automation and Artificial Intelligence are all integrated with traditional industries. New theories, new business segments, new commercial models, new technologies are emerging in an endless stream.</p>
									 
									<p align="justify">We must learn humbly, sincerely, proactively and understand the laws and regulations, learn and master the developing trends, follow the trends and grow with it. We should invest time in acquiring the knowledge of not only our own duties and functions but also other functions, thereby constantly improving our overall awareness, and enhancing our abilities to collaborate.</p>
                               
                               		<p align="justify"><strong>Innovation</strong></p>
									
									<p align="justify">Innovation is the limitless motivating force behind the development of Ok Lifecare. Today, unpredictable and significant changes are taking place in the business environment; financial policies are shifting, trading relationships are changing, and new industries are emerging.  All Ok Lifecare staff should innovate on new ideas and systems. I particularly require the Department, Functional and Regional Heads to perform as role models, to think and demand innovations from their teams and manage these innovations well. We will develop specific solutions which support innovations, encourage innovations and promote an innovation-oriented culture, so that we continue to remain firmly on the path of innovation.</p>
                               
                               		<p align="justify"><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
									
									<p align="justify">To implement the systems effectively, will require significant system and process re-engineering. Efforts by only one Department or a few individuals will not only see us fail to achieve our goals, but more importantly will result in lost growth opportunities and may even hurt our existing business. All Department, Functional & Regional Heads need to acknowledge the importance of peer to peer collaboration. All supporting functions need to give the highest priority to the facilitation, collaboration and support the systems. Whether you are responsible for an internal department project or an inter-department project, you need to proactively take the lead and collaborate across teams, functions and departments; over-communicate rather than under-communicate, and build bridges and ties between colleagues. If there is a person or unit responsible for a project, try to support it; if the responsible person or unit is not clear, try to bridge the missing skills, knowledge or information proactively, ensuring that all tasks are properly managed to deliver the desired results. We come from everywhere and build our Ok Lifecare Family with one common objective; we all are brothers and sisters, forming one family, in the same boat, sharing both joys and sorrows, success and failure. All regions, all departments and all Ok Lifecare people need to strive for better collaboration no matter whether it is between regions, departments or individuals. We need to help each other, support each other, and remind each other that we are all heading to the same place, and we all form the different strands of one rope; separated only by our duties, but we are still one family, and strengthened by our collective synergies. All Ok Lifecare people must be united together and act like one person, for generating the effect of 1+1 greater than 10, or even changing the way of growing from addition to multiplication, or even to the way of geometric progression, wining and growing collectively.</p>
                               
                               		<p align="justify"><strong>Diligence</strong></p>
									
									<p align="justify">God rewards the diligent. Regardless of age, no one can achieve grand goals without sufficient diligence and dedication. Diligence needs to be the conscious action of all Ok Lifecare Family Members; an attitude, a fashion and a culture at Ok Lifecare. Each Ok Lifecare Family Member, regardless of your seniority or capability, should love your job and strictly attend to your duties. You need to plan the outcomes for your work daily and strive to complete all your tasks in a timely manner, not postponing to the next day what you can finish today. Take personal responsibility for your tasks, be accountable for your results and don’t avoid the tough jobs hoping someone else will do it. When you perform a task, strive for perfection; do things diligently, accurately and precisely the first time so that you do not have to repeat it again. Ok Lifecare has always had a good culture of diligence. This is my creed and I hope every Ok Lifecare Family Member will continue to be a diligent person.</p>
                               
                               		<p align="justify"><strong>Striving</strong></p>
									
									<p align="justify">It is said that talk is cheap and only actions have value. All achievements during Ok Lifecare’ 03 years of history are the result of each step and effort invested by the individual Ok Lifecare Family Members.  Our road ahead is filled with steep mountains, dangerous shoals and all kinds of difficulties, failures, frustrations and slanders; however, we do not lack intelligences, capabilities and virtues, and nothing can stop the Ok Lifecare Family Member who possess infinite persistence and perseverance. We need people with high IQ, high EQ, unwavering personal ethics, confident, bright and proud of who we are, equipped with managerial courage, members who are reliable and practical. So long as we have breath in our bodies we will continue to fight and never give up without achieving our goals.</p>
                               
                               		<p align="justify"><strong>Happiness</strong></p>
									
									<p align="justify">Happiness can mean both a sort of spirit and something concrete, both an objective existence and an intuitive feeling, pursuing the belief of providing the highest level of service and quality to our customers, to make every Ok Lifecare client feel happy. We should think more about the happiness of all Ok Lifecare Family Members, try and build a mutually respectful multi-cultural environment, that benefits everyone and makes us all happy to work in Ok Lifecare. We will establish a broad platform, recruiting elite talents from all areas, maximizing their intelligences and capabilities, making them dazzlingly brilliant.
